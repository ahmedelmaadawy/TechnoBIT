            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>

              Founded in 2024 by Ahmed Elmaadawy, Techno BIT has come a long way
              from its beginnings. When Ahmed first started out, his passion for
              "high-quality tech products" drove him to quit his day job, do
              tons of research, and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and
              inspiration into a booming online store. We now serve customers
              all over the world and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky,
              eco-friendly, fair trade wing of the tech industry.
